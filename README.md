# Motion_Planning_algorithms
This repository contains the implementation of motion planning algorithms.
## Dated 20/2/19
### Steps to run. 
  Run the file main_5.py which has the implementation of A star and ANA star. Running the code as it is will run the ANA star algorithm a modified hard maze.
  To Run a star. Comment the line 117,404 and remove the comments in line 111,115,406-416. 
  This is the work done by the time of submission of deadline.
  
  The code will be improved in further updations.
  The repository will also be updated with an unified code with an implementation of all the discrete motion planning algorithms with performance analysis.
